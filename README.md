# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Internship

## Introduction

I acted as part of the Retail Analytics project led by Quantium's retail analytics team. This project aimed to provide actionable insights to optimize sales and customer engagement for a retail company. Our analysis included examining customer purchasing behavior for the Chip category and evaluating the impact of a store trial conducted in select stores.

## Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

### Objective
We analyzed customer purchasing behavior and derived insights to inform strategic recommendations.

### Key Findings
- Identified three customer segments: Budget, Mainstream, and Premium.
- Mainstream customers contributed the highest total sales, followed by Budget and Premium segments.
- Observed seasonal variations in sales, with December showing significant increases.
- Sales Trends: Mainstream - Young Singles/Couples and Mainstream - Retirees are the primary contributors to chip sales. However, the Budget - Older Families segment shows a different pattern, suggesting they might have unique preferences or habits.
- Chip Consumption Habits: Families, both older and younger, tend to buy more chips per customer compared to other groups. This indicates a higher affinity for chips within family-oriented demographics.
- Price Sensitivity: Mainstream mid-age and young singles/couples are willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to budget and premium shoppers. This could be due to their preferences for indulgence or entertainment.

### Recommendations
- We recommended focusing marketing efforts on Mainstream customers for maximum revenue.
- Suggested tailoring promotions based on product preferences and price sensitivity.
- Advised continuously monitoring sales trends for targeted marketing strategies.

## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

### Objective
We evaluated the impact of a store trial on total sales revenue and customer behavior.

### Control Store Selection
- Conducted correlation analysis to calculate correlation coefficient between stores based on key metrics.
- Determined differences in key metrics, normalized for comparison.
- Chose control stores with high correlation and low differences to trial stores.

### Key Findings
- Found a positive impact of trial layouts on sales revenue and customer count in March and April.
- Noted a weakening impact in May and June, indicating potential for refinement.

### Recommendations
- Suggested assessing trial layout effectiveness for sustained sales growth.
- Advised refining layouts based on insights from analysis to maximize impact.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and the impact of trial layouts on sales performance. By leveraging these insights, the retail company can optimize marketing strategies, tailor promotions, and enhance customer engagement to drive sustainable growth and success.
